## Overview

Phishing attacks are a common cyber threat where attackers attempt to deceive individuals into revealing sensitive information such as login credentials, credit card numbers, or personal data. This project demonstrates how phishing emails and fake websites can be used to lure victims and provides insights into mitigation strategies.

## Features

- **Customizable Phishing Templates:** Create and modify phishing email templates for different scenarios.
- **Fake Login Pages:** Simulate websites that mimic legitimate ones to demonstrate credential harvesting techniques.
- **Data Logging:** Track user interactions with phishing links and login forms.
- **Awareness Training:** Highlight common indicators of phishing attacks to educate users.

## Setup

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/iem-haseeb/Insta-Phising-Attack.git
   cd phishing-attack-simulation
   ```



## Usage

1. Launch the server to start the phishing simulation.
2. Send phishing emails to test accounts (created for the purpose of this project).
3. Interact with the fake phishing website to understand the attack vector.
4. Review the logs to analyze the collected data.

> **Note:** Use this tool in a controlled environment only, such as a private lab setup.



## Important Notes

1. **Ethical Use:** This project must only be used in compliance with ethical hacking guidelines and applicable laws.
2. **Test Environment:** Conduct simulations in isolated environments to avoid any accidental harm.
3. **User Awareness:** Use this project to educate users about recognizing phishing attempts.
